## Future Plans for AutoML.NFT

1. Our main **vision** for AutoML.NFT is to grow it into an **"Analytics/ML entrance gate" for end-users** from business, industry, government, and NGOs, to conduct automated data analysis and access analytics reports. Rather than being an "Output only" type of application, the system we envision is a **Web 3.0 community**, where goods such as datasets and data analytics reports are generated, posted, propogated, and traded. 
2. Users can be allowed to **download source code** used in creating the analysis reports, possibly at a minor additional charge, opening the door for revenue and **codenomics** (economics of code).
3. A full-fledged **datanomics** model can be created, that will enable **monetization from the AutoML.NFT dapp**. Basic ideas of displaying paid ads and selling generated reports are already implemented. The parameters of the fitted/selected/suggested ML model are displayed in the analysis report. Building on these basics, much more could be possible. Possibilities include selling source data, intermediate computed data (ex: train/test data for each fold), rendered interactive charts and animations, and as mentioned earlier, source code. A subscription-based model can also be adopted, where subscribers pay upfront monthly or annual fees, which can bring them big savings. If a token is to be issued for AutoML.NFT, a full-fledged [tokenomics design](https://maxyampolsky.medium.com/how-to-design-tokenomics-for-your-cryptocurrency-the-basics-of-creating-your-token-9a0375cb9479) is needed, which mitigates against different types of technical, legal, economic, and social risks, and ensures economics value and growth. For example, in both datanomics and tokenomics design, it is important to make sure not to distribute tokens to users randomly, as this may be [labeled as lottery and sued by some users](https://cryptobriefing.com/a-guy-put-10-ethereum-defi-app/).
4. Users can be allowed to **customize report style** by selecting [color palettes](https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/website-color-palettes/) for the visualizations in the analysis reports. These palettes can include pallets that are suitable for [color blindness](https://www.color-blindness.com/), similar to [R packages for color blindness](https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/top-r-color-palettes-to-know-for-great-data-visualization/). Another possibility is to use [color palettes inspired by photos of nature](https://sarahrenaeclark.com/color-palettes/).
5. Several **other analyses categories and types** can be added to the analysis reports. 
6. Customized AutoML **report templates/boilerplates** can be made available, especially for publicly-available data, such as on-chain data from blockchains. These templates can include analysis of [NFTs](https://dune.xyz/panta_rhei/NFt), [Whales](https://www.whalestats.com/analysis-of-the-top-1000-avalanche-wallets), [MemPools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhAelJJtr4k), as well as other analyses in blockchain analytics platforms, such as [GlassNode](https://glassnode.com). There can even be detailed analytics templates for Dapps, as in the top Dapp directory, [DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/).
7. Existing and new visual analytics methods can be implemented using **alternative libraries**, including Python visualization/animation/storytelling libraries (such as [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html)) whose output may be displayed on the frontend within the dapp.
8. **Advanced data analytics methods** and [machine learning (ML)](https://www.coursera.org/collections/machine-learning) algorithms, including **deep learning, unsupervised learning** and even **prescriptive analytics**, can be implemented within the dapp into the future, using some of the [top data science software libraries](https://towardsdatascience.com/8-booming-data-science-libraries-you-must-watch-out-in-2022-cec2dbb42437).
9. With the permission of the user, meta-data about the analyzed data and analysis results, as well as metrics in the generated reports, can be **published on** [ChainLink](https://chain.link) and other **oracles as feeds**.  
10. Transactions and other **feeds can be published as webhooks** [as described here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41NOoEz3Tzc), **allowing RPA tools** such as [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), [CaptainData](https://app.captaindata.co), [Konnectzit](https://app.konnectzit.com) and [Hexomatic](https://hexomatic.com) **to connect to these hooks** and perform many interesting actions, including **automated notification/signal/alert push messages to social media**.
11. The visualizations and ML results in the analysis reports can be described automatically using **AI-generated text narrations**, using [GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/) or other text-generation/NLP (Natural Language Processing) libraries, or APIs that build on those libraries, such as the [Rytr API](https://rytr.me/developers/api#register) for automated text generation. Such text can also be transformed into voice through **text-to-speech** technology and libraries and embedded into pdf reports or reports in other more advanced interactive data formats.
12. On the documentation side, the developed code, especially the Javascript **code can be visually documented** using [SmartDraw's Automated Class Diagrams Extensions](htpps://www.smartdraw.com/developers/extensions/class-diagram.htm)
13. On the documentation side, the documentation can be put into a **better format** using [GitBook](https://gitbook.com), just like the [GitBook documentation of TraderJoe](https://docs.traderjoexyz.com/main/welcome/master).
14. Many **other opportunities** for improvement have been identified and listed through brain storming sessions and are available as internal notes.
15. Last but not least, AutoML.NFT can use **quantum computing** (only emulators, for now) to generate reports for much larger datasets quickly. [TensorFlow Quantum](https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum) and other emulators can be used for this purpose and this functionality can be enabled when quantum computers become publicly accessible.
