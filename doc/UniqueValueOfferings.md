## Unique Value Offerings

AutoML.NFT brings the following **value offerings to blockchain world**, as well as ***business and industry** around the world:

![Proposition of AutoML.NFT](./img/Slide04.png) 

While there are multiple Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) and AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) platforms in the market, as shown below, AutoML.NFT is -to the best of our knowledge- the **first platform to interact with a blockchain and offer an ML Reports Marketplace.**

![Benchmark with Other AutoML Platforms](./img/Slide05.png) 

The most relevant **benchmark** to the project in the blockchain world is the [Ocean Market](https://market.oceanprotocol.com/), powered by [Ocean Protocol](https://oceanprotocol.com/), where practically anyone can upload a data, put it on sale, and profit from sales or staking. Besides putting data for sale, advanced users can also [set up and run their own marketplaces](https://oceanprotocol.com/build). 

AutoML.NFT differs from Ocean in that the **focus of AutoML.NFT** is the **analysis of data and monetization of analysis reports**, rather than the monetization of data itself as in Ocean Market. To this end, AutoML.NFT's proposition is a working implemented system that did not exist before.
