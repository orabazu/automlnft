There are multiple **Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) and AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) platforms** in the market. 

![Benchmark with Other AutoML Platforms](./img/Slide05.png) 

AutoML.NFT is -to the best of our knowledge- the first platform to interact with a blockchain and offer an ML Reports Marketplace.

The most relevant benchmark to the project in the blockchain world is the [Ocean Market](https://market.oceanprotocol.com/), powered by [Ocean Protocol](https://oceanprotocol.com/), where practically anyone can upload a data, put it on sale, and profit from sales or staking. Besides putting data for sale, advanced users can also [set up and run their own marketplaces](https://oceanprotocol.com/build). AutoML.NFT differs from Ocean in that the **focus of AutoML.NFT** is the *analysis* of data and monetization of *analysis reports*, rather than the monetization of data itself as in Ocean Market. To this end, AutoML.NFT's proposition is a working implemented system that did not exist before.
