## Frontend

This section describes each screen of AutoML.NFT.

### Home Page
This is the screen that welcomes the user. There are two main options, either generating new report or buying an existing report generated by others. Wallet connection is needed for both of these paths.

![Screen01](Screen01.png)

### Connecting Wallet
Either a new wallet is created or an existing wallet is imported using seed phrase.

![Screen02](Screen02.png)

### Generated Wallet
Address shown on the upper right corner, with balance

![Screen03](Screen03.png)

### Instructions
Instructions on how to use AutoML.NFT are displayed upfront, as a process. The progress of the user throughout the progress is shown by the timeline on the top, that begins with "Connect Wallet".

### Upload Data
An xlsx file, that contains the data, is uploaded in this step.

![Screen05](Screen05.png)

### See Data
The uploaded data can be visually inspected at this step.

### Select Data Type
The type and role of each data field (each row in the table) is specified on this screen.

### Monetization through Advertisement
While the ML algorithm is running and generating the pdf report, advertisement can be displayed for monetization. Here, we show a bouncing barcode that points to a blockchain service, similar to the viral Coinbase advertisement in Super Bowl 2022 (a.k.a., Crypto Bowl 2022).

### Results
The results of ML are displayed on this screen. It should be noted that only the metrics are displayed. Critical parameters of the selected/suggested ML model are not shown. Furthermore, detailed analytics are not shown, either. Those are available only in the pdf report, which needs to be purchased.

### Buy Full Report
When the blue button "I want to buy full report" is clicked, the price to be paid (10 XRP, in this case, totaling to 10.000012 XRP together with gas fees) is displayed.

### Buy Transaction Submitted
When the blue button "Buy the generated report" is clicked, the transaction is submitted to XRPL.

![Screen11](Screen11.png)

### Mint NFT
When the purchase transaction is completed, the NFT minting starts.

![Screen12](Screen12.png)

### Show Report
Once the NFT minting is completed, the Analysis Result report is displayed, together with the Token ID. At this point, the report can be -optionally put on the marketplace and- downloaded.

![Screen13](Screen13.png)

### Set Sale Price
If the report is to be put on the marketplace, a price can be set on this screen. In this example, the sale price is set as 25 XRP, and "Create Sell Offer" blue button will be clicked.

![Screen14](Screen14.png)

### Sell Offer Created
The creation of the sell offer is communicated, as in other steps, as a small message at the bottom right of the screen.

![Screen15](Screen15.png)

### NFT List
List of NFTs of the user with this wallet is shown on this screen. In this example, there is only one report available as NFT Certificate of Ownership. The wallet that owns this NFT is the same connected wallet.

![Screen16](Screen16.png)

### Sale Status
When the blue "Show Sale Status" button is clicked in the NFT dashboard, the sale status of that NFT is displayed. In this example, the selected NFT is on sale for 25 XRP.

![Screen17](Screen17.png)


### Buying an Existing NFT
An existing ML analysis report can be purchased, as well, through this screen, which is accessed through the Home Page, by clicking "Buy Report". In this screen, an NFT whose public key is entered can be displayed, along with its sale status.
