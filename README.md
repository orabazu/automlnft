## Start Here:

- [**AutoML.NFT Dapp**](https://lucid-mayer-4a70a5.netlify.app/) is running live on the cloud.
- [**Sample "restaurant" dataset**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5q61bqr136m52sf/dataset.xlsx?dl=0) can be used to test the dapp. Under Role, role for "RestaurantID" should be "Id" and role for "Satisfaction" should be "Target".
- [**Documentation**](./doc/Documentation.md) describes the project and the dapp.
- [**YouTube Video**](https://youtu.be/CwoCla53aFI) is the demo video for the hackathon.


## Executive Summary
  
[AutoML.NFT app](https://github.com/albert-vo-crypto/automlnft) is 
- **a Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platform** to 
- interactively and dynamically **generate Machine Learning (ML) report** for uploaded data files, and 
- **issue NFT tokens** on the [XRP Ledger](https://xrpl.org/index.html) as certificate of ownership. 
AutoMLNFT also provides an analytical marketplace, where legal ownership of ML reports can be bought. The project also provides a template for XRPL and other blockchains on how MLaaS dapps with innovative features can be developed on the blockchain.

The app was designed, developed, and implemented during the period of [XRPL NFT Hackathon](https://xrplnft.devpost.com/) by the project team. 

The documentation herein describes the application and presents a blue print of how the system can be developed into the future over an extended time period.

# Vite + React + Typescript + Eslint + Prettier

A starter for React with Typescript with the fast Vite and all static code testing with Eslint and formatting with Prettier.

![Vite + React + Typescript + Eslint + Prettier](/resources/screenshot.png)

We found out about Vite and wanted to have a boilerplate for the technologies that we used. You can find more about these in the following links: 
- [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) 
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
